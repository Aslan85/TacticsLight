# Tactics Light

This is the source code for 「Tactics Light」, an open source tactical RPG inspired by Tactics Ogre. It's a recreational and competitive video game played between two players.

## Concept

Tactics Light is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a rectangular board with 40 squares arranged in an five-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls five pieces that they have previously chosen among a set of 3 classes: Squire, Knight, Archer. The object of the game is to destroy the opponent's tower, all the opponent's soldiers, or the opponent's leader.

## Game Engine

This game is made with [Heaps.io](https://heaps.io/), a mature cross platform graphics engine designed for high performance games. It's free and open source and It's designed to leverage modern GPUs that are commonly available on both desktop and mobile devices.
